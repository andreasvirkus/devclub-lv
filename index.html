Allow me to introduce myself: I'm Andreas & I've been a developer at Klaus for over two
and a half years now. I've seen some lows and am enjoying the highs. We'll get into
where Klaus was when I joined in a bit, but first, let's talk about... üëâ

Where Klaus is today:

- ‚Ç¨6M raised
- 26 employees
- Closing in on ‚Ç¨1M ARR
- Dealing with (rapidly increasing) large data volumes
  - handling around `N` data points (TODO: ask @Joonathan for impressive facts here)
  - Handling N conversations per day?
  - ...X, Y, Z?
- Shipping fast and often, delivering (experimenting with?) machine learning
- Restructuring (preparing to restructure...?) ourselves internally

Let's start with our founders. Martin was the global head of customer support of Pipedrive at the time,
trying to figure out the most optimal way of tracking and measuring the quality of his team's support interactions.

Excel quickly became painful, taking minutes to even load up the spreadsheet itself.

Kair, Martin's lifelong friend and partner in crime for many former endeavours - decides to find a "less talk, let's build"
developer (Egon) to construct the first prototype of Klaus.

MVP launches, Klaus lands their first clients and pre-seed funding.

Talk about how crucial your first users are and how they'll almost feel like
employees if utilised (and served!) right.

Try to profile early employees - multitools, passionate, adaptable.

Summer: two wild cowboys join and declare they want to build a new thing from scratch.
=> Discuss through the architectural trade-offs, etc

Fall: we almost freeze the product, working full-time on the new version from scratch.
Egon continues to deliver features on the MVP, but some features are cut to not
deliver them twice (MVP + v1.0).

Meanwhile sales does a lot of cold outreach, teasing the promise of v1.0

We get the v1.0 launched within 2 months. It feels as a huge accomplishment, but
has little impact on the business. Meanwhile, our runway's stretching mighty thin.

The year starts off incredibly strong. It finally seems that v1.0 actually paid off.

Acquiring new customers, employees, polishing the product, talk **gravity** and attracting
talent (Valentina, Medea).

Engineering worries about scale & performance. CEO keeps reminding us to not over-optimise
for non-existing hypotheticals and... üëá
